## 1. Introduction

This tutorial teaches you how a small Pygame program simulates a fractal, Fibonacci-based tree. Branch lengths and spreads follow Fibonacci-derived ratios so the resulting shape looks natural and organic.

You'll see:
- How the recursive `grow()` function builds branches.
- Why some branches look thicker or greener.
- How to convert the growth stage into parallel tasks so multiple branches can be computed at the same time, using Python threads.

The tutorial ends with a complete multithreaded version ready to copy and run.



## 2. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (works well with 3.10 / 3.11)
- `pygame` installed (`pip install pygame`)
- Basic knowledge of Python functions and threading concepts
- Optional: `concurrent.futures` familiarity

## 5. Deep explanation — line by line and concept by concept

I'll walk through the important pieces and why they exist.

### a) Initialization and constants

- `pygame.init()` starts Pygame.
- `WIN_WIDTH`, `WIN_HEIGHT` — screen size.
- Color constants defined as RGB tuples.
- Tree parameters such as `TREE_DEPTH`, `BRANCH_WIDTH`, `SPREAD_BASE`, etc., control how deep the recursion goes, how thick branches start, and how widely they spread.

**Tip:** Keep `TREE_DEPTH` moderate (7–12). Too large creates many branches and can slow rendering and thread overhead.

### b) Fibonacci function

```python
def fib(n):
    a, b = 1, 1
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```

- Returns the nth Fibonacci number (1-indexed here).
- Used to compute ratios that change with depth — making lower/higher branches differ organically.

### c) Recursive growth: `grow()`

`grow(x, y, length, angle, depth, width)` does the heavy lifting.

Key steps inside:
1. Base case: stop when depth <= 0 or length is tiny.
2. Compute end coordinates using trigonometry:
   - `end_x = x + sin(angle) * length`
   - `end_y = y - cos(angle) * length`
3. Prevent branches dipping below the ground by clamping `end_y`.
4. Append the branch to the `branches` list: `branches.append(((x, y), (end_x, end_y), width, depth))`.
5. Compute Fibonacci-based scale `f_ratio` and `spread` to determine how much children diverge.
6. Decide `sub_branches` — number of children, varied with Fibonacci.
7. Loop through children, derive `new_length`, `new_angle` (biased upwards), clamp angles, reduce width, then recursively call `grow()` with `depth - 1`.

This recursion builds a flattened list `branches` which is later drawn progressively in the main loop.

### d) Drawing loop and `draw_step`

- `branches` is precomputed once by `grow(...)` starting at the trunk base.
- Once user clicks, `draw_step` increases and the program draws `branches[:draw_step]` to animate growth.
- Color interpolation between brown and green depends on depth to simulate branch → leaf transition.



## 6. Why and when to parallelize

The algorithm is CPU-heavy when `TREE_DEPTH` is high — recursively creating many branches. Parallelizing the **generation** (not the drawing) can bring speed benefits on multicore machines.

**Important**: Pygame drawing calls must happen in the main thread on many platforms. So you parallelize only the computationally heavy part: generating branch geometry (`branches` list). Drawing stays single-threaded.

When to parallelize:
- If `TREE_DEPTH >= 11` or you notice long pauses at startup while branches are computed.
- If you want quicker precomputation before animating the growth.



## 7. Design choices for multithreading

Options:
- `threading.Thread` and manual queue/lock management.
- `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` — simpler, higher-level.

Constraints & safety:
- The shared `branches` list must be protected by a `threading.Lock` during append operations.
- Avoid creating thousands of concurrent threads. Use a bounded pool (`max_workers = min(32, os.cpu_count() or 4)`) to limit resource usage.
- Keep recursion depth per thread modest; better approach: have each submitted task compute an entire subtree (e.g., `grow()` from a given node down to a shallow depth) and append the resulting local list to the global list under a lock.

Strategy implemented below:
- The main `grow_parallel()` will push top-level child `grow` tasks into an executor.
- Each worker runs a variant `grow_worker()` that returns a local list of branches for that subtree.
- The main thread collects futures and merges results into the global `branches` once each future completes (safe merging under lock).

This design reduces lock contention (threads only lock briefly to append a chunk) and keeps Pygame drawing safe.

```

**Notes about the code above**:
- `grow_worker()` performs the recursion only *locally* and returns a `local` list of branches rather than appending to a global list while computing. This avoids heavy lock contention.
- `generate_tree_parallel()` handles trunk creation synchronously, then schedules multiple subtree computations via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. When a future completes, its result is merged into `branches` under `branches_lock`.
- The renderer still draws from `branches` on the main thread.



## 9. How to run and test

1. Save the file as `fibonacci_tree_parallel.py`.
2. Install pygame if necessary: `pip install pygame`.
3. Run: `python fibonacci_tree_parallel.py`.
4. Click the window to start the growth animation.

**Testing tips**:
- Try small/large `TREE_DEPTH` values to observe performance changes.
- Toggle `max_workers` or the strategy to see CPU/time tradeoffs.



## 10. Performance considerations & debugging tips

- Python threads are limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for pure-Python CPU-bound tasks. However, splitting heavy recursion into multiple threads often helps if some operations release the GIL (not the case here) OR if overhead (waiting for random numbers, I/O) exists. Still, for pure CPU-bound tasks, `multiprocessing` may give better scaling. The thread approach helps eliminate GUI freeze because branch generation tasks are off the main thread.

- If you want true parallel CPU utilization for heavy depth, consider `multiprocessing` instead. It requires serializing results between processes (e.g., `multiprocessing.Pool`), but it avoids the GIL.

- Keep `branches` merging minimal and batched. Appending many single branches under a lock causes contention. Returning a local list and merging it once avoids this.

- On Windows, `pygame` must run in the main thread. Don't attempt to call Pygame display or drawing from worker threads.



## 11. FAQ and closing notes

**Q: Why not call `grow()` directly in multiple threads (no `local` lists)?**
A: That creates lock contention (every branch append needs a lock) and increases the chance of subtle bugs. Using local results and merging is safer and faster.

**Q: Can I parallelize drawing?**
A: No — drawing must stay in the main thread for portability and correctness.

**Q: When should I use `multiprocessing` instead?**
A: Use it when `TREE_DEPTH` is large (e.g., 12+) and CPU usage is the bottleneck. It has higher overhead but avoids the GIL.




### Final thoughts

This tutorial shows how to understand the original recursive fractal generator and how to safely run expensive geometry generation in parallel without touching the GUI thread. Use the provided code as a starting point — tweak parameters, depths, and the pool strategy to match your CPU and artistic goal.

Happy coding and happy tree-growing!
