Hello friends, today we will again do socket programming for multiple clients and a single server. Just like before, it's about creating multiple client sockets and transmitting their 
videos to a server in Python. The new thing is to save each client's frames as a separate video. The client.py utilizes OpenCv to access the video frames either from the live webcam or through the MP4 video. The server side code 
runs multi-threading to display video frame which is optional from each of the connected client. 

## Requirements for this project

```
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
pip3 install pyshine
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install imutils
```

Each client must know the IP of the server. Both the server and client should be connected to the same wifi router. Depending on the operating system, you can easily find the IP address of your machine as follows:

### IP address for MAC OS users

Go to the terminal window and run this command:

```
ipconfig getifaddr en0

```
It will show your LAN IP address. Note that en0 is commonly used for ethernet interface, and en1 is for the Airport interface. Make sure that your IP address is not starting from 127.x.x.x because that is your local host, and if you only want to check server client for the same pc then it is fine. Otherwise, consider use the command above and write the correct ip address for video transfer over different machines. 


###  IP address for Linux/Ubuntu OS users

From the terminal window run this command:

```
ifconfig
```
The required IP address will be for Wifi LAN (inet)

###  IP address for Windows OS users

From the cmd window run this command:

```
ipconfig
```

The required IP address will be shown against IPv4 Address

The client code is exactly same as before.

### client.py
{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python

# Welcome to PyShine
# lets make the client code
# In this code client is sending video to server
import socket,cv2, pickle,struct
import pyshine as ps # pip install pyshine
import imutils # pip install imutils
camera = True
if camera == True:
	vid = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
else:
	vid = cv2.VideoCapture('videos/mario.mp4')
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
host_ip = '192.168.1.11' # Here according to your server ip write the address

port = 9999
client_socket.connect((host_ip,port))

if client_socket: 
	while (vid.isOpened()):
		try:
			img, frame = vid.read()
			frame = imutils.resize(frame,width=380)
			a = pickle.dumps(frame)
			message = struct.pack("Q",len(a))+a
			client_socket.sendall(message)
			cv2.imshow(f"TO: {host_ip}",frame)
			key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
			if key == ord("q"):
				client_socket.close()
		except:
			print('VIDEO FINISHED!')
			break

```

The server side code is update to save the client's video .mp4 with a name that is generated by using the date time at server side.

### server.py
{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python

# Welcome to PyShine
# In this video server is receiving video from clients and also record them with any names
# Lets import the libraries
import socket, cv2, pickle, struct
import imutils
import threading
import pyshine as ps # pip install pyshine
import cv2
from datetime import datetime

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
host_name  = socket.gethostname()
host_ip = socket.gethostbyname(host_name)
print('HOST IP:',host_ip)
port = 9999
socket_address = (host_ip,port)
server_socket.bind(socket_address)
server_socket.listen()
print("Listening at",socket_address)

                    break
            client_socket.close()
    except Exception as e:

        pass
