description: A quick tutorial on multi threading in python to play twinkle twinkle little start poem
---




Hi there! 

Hello everyone 
Welcome to Pyshine and today we will play a poem
By using the wav files for each note of the Piano
I have a folder of wave files 
You may easily find the folder from the link below
https://freesound.org/people/TEDAgame/packs/25405/


Ok so lets start the coding
First we require the list of notes so

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python

Twinkle_List = ['c4','c4','g4','g4','a4','a4','g4',\
				'f4','f4','e4','e4','d4','d4','c4',\
				'g5','g5','f4','f4','e4','e4','d4',\
				'g5','g5','f4','f4','e4','e4','d4',\
				'c4','c4','g4','g4','a4','a4','g4',\
				'f4','f4','e4','e4','d4','d4','c4',\
				]
```

This list has a total of 48 notes, and each line has 7 notes
We will play each note one by one and when we reach 
the end of a line , we simply give a pause of 1 second
Between each note we will give a 0.3 second pause


Lets import the required Libraries

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python
from threading import Thread
import pygame as pg 
import time 
```
First we initialize the mixer of pygame pg

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python
pg.mixer.init()
pg.init()
```
To be on safe side we will make the number of mixer 
channels to be equal to the number of elements in the 
Twinkle_List	

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python
pg.mixer.set_num_channels(len(Twinkle_List))
```
Now its time to make the function 

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python
def play_notes(notePath,duration):
	time.sleep(duration) # make a pause 
	pg.mixer.Sound(notePath).play()
	time.sleep(duration) # Let the sound play 
	print(notePath) # To see which note is now playing
```
Next is to make the path , all wav files are in Sounds folder
A total of 88 wav files

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python
path  = 'Sounds/'

cnt =1	# A counter to delay once a line is finished as there
# are 6 total lines
```
We now make a dictionary for each thread th

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python
th = {}
```
Lets iterate the Twinkle_List and launch each thread to
Play the note

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python
for t in Twinkle_List:
	th[t] = Thread(target = play_notes,args = (path+'{}.wav'.format(t),0.3))
	# These are arguments (path+'{}.wav'.format(t),0.3)
	# Lets start the thread
	th[t].start()
	th[t].join()
	if cnt%7==0:
		print("---Long Pause---")
		time.sleep(1) # Let the sound play for the last note of each line
		
	cnt+=1
```
Thats all lets play the code
This time we also visualize the waveform
That visualizer will be explained in next lab
Just have fun

Have a nice and healthy day!
