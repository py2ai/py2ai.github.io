Today i am going to start a tutorial series about Keras library. Lets visit website of this Deep learning library https://keras.io. Keras is a high-level neural networks API. What is API? Its Application Program Interface. API is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. It is written in Python and its open source. We can have a deeper look into different learning networks. It is built on top of different libraries such as TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

## What is a Tensor and its flow

The term Tensor is used for an N dimensional array, where N can be any number and in Neural Networks we have layers as shown here:
input -> first hidden layer-> second hidden layer->...output.
So tensors flow from input to these layers from one layer to another thats why it is called tensor flow. Just like we pass a matrix to one layer and it is multiplied by weights and then passed to another.
 

## Keras simple Sequential Model

Simplest type of model is the Sequential() model. Lets make a new folder named lab1 and make an empty python file named basic.py. First we need to import an empty Sequential model. Add this code to basic.py.
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
```
Since this is a very basic tutorial, lets save this model and view it. We need to import plot_model that can help us to save the image of model. 
```python
from keras.utils import plot_model
```
Lets import input layer (Dense) and add it to the empty Model. The Dense layer's input_shape is (3,1). It can be fed with a matrix of 3 columns and 1 dimension. The number of rows of the input matrix can be of any length. By default the input_shape has a None for the number of rows in the input matrix. The input matrix is used for the X_train or X_test part of the data. On the other hand Y_train or Y_test are the output of the Dense layer. The 10 which is first element in the Dense layer, defines the number of output units.

```python
from keras.layers import Dense
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(10,input_shape=(3, 1), activation='sigmoid'))
```
This simple Dense layer model will take an input data with shape of (Any-number-of-rows,3 columns,1 dimension). The output will be a vector of size 10. Lets see how our model looks like by adding this last line to the code. And lets run the code.
Open powershell and type : python basic.py. As a result you will find a mymodel.png file in the lab1 folder.
```python
plot_model(model, to_file='mymodel.png', show_shapes=True)
```
![]({{ "assets/img/posts/basic_keras_model.png" | absolute_url }})

Thats all for this lab 1. In the next lab 2 we will learn about more layers to a model. Thanks for reading. Code is [available](https://github.com/py2ai/Keras-Labs). I hope this will be helpful for the beginners.
