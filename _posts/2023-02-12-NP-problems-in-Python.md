Hello friends! Lets first talk about NP problems and then get to the coding part.

# NP problems
NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time) problems are a class of computational problems for which no efficient solution algorithm has been found, but for which it is believed that a solution can be verified quickly. In other words, the problem can be solved in an exponential amount of time, but the solution can be checked in polynomial time.

Examples of NP problems include:
* Traveling Salesman Problem, 
* Knapsack Problem, 
* Satisfiability (SAT) Problem.

These problems are of significant interest in the field of theoretical computer science and have been widely studied for many years. Despite much effort, a polynomial-time algorithm for any NP-complete problem has yet to be found.

It is widely believed that NP problems are fundamentally hard and that there is no efficient solution algorithm for them, although this has not been proven. The distinction between NP problems and those that can be solved efficiently (in polynomial time) is one of the most important open questions in computer science and mathematics, and is known as the P versus NP problem.
