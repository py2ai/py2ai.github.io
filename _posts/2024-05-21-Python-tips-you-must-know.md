#1. Indexing Tricks

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```python
phrase = "Goodbye, world!"
print(phrase[::-1])

"""
!dlrow ,eybdooG
"""
```
Python indexing allows users to access a subset of a sequence. The index represents the position of an element in the sequence. While mutable sequences allow slicing for data extraction and modification, attempting to modify slices of immutable sequences raises a TypeError.

The slicing format in Python is sequence`[start:stop:step]`. If no values are specified for start, stop, and step, the sequence defaults to:

Start: 0
Stop: length of the sequence
Step: 1 (if not specified)
Negative indices can also be passed, facilitating sequence reversal. For instance, in a list with four elements, the 0th index is equivalent to the -4 index, and the last index corresponds to -1. Leveraging this knowledge, the given example code prints the string in reverse order.


#2. Efficient Variable Swapping
