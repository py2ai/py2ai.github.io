from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Train a machine learning model
# (Include your specific machine learning code here)
```

or a complete example script:

```python

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from datetime import datetime

# Load example solar panel data from CSV
example_data = """

# Create a DataFrame from the example data
solar_data = pd.read_csv(pd.compat.StringIO(example_data), parse_dates=['Datetime'])

# Feature Engineering: Extract hour of day as a new feature
solar_data['Hour_of_Day'] = solar_data['Datetime'].dt.hour

# Define features and target variable
features = ['Sunlight_Intensity', 'Panel_Temperature', 'Hour_of_Day']
target = 'Energy_Production'

# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_data, test_data = train_test_split(solar_data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a machine learning model
model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
model.fit(train_data[features], train_data[target])

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = model.predict(test_data[features])

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(test_data[target], predictions)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Example: Predict energy production for a specific time
example_input = [[400, 30, 12]]  # Example input features (Sunlight_Intensity, Panel_Temperature, Hour_of_Day)
predicted_energy = model.predict(example_input)
print(f'Predicted Energy Production: {predicted_energy[0]}')

# Simple optimization strategy: Use more energy during peak solar production times
peak_hours = solar_data.groupby('Hour_of_Day')['Energy_Production'].mean().idxmax()
optimized_energy_usage = solar_data[solar_data['Hour_of_Day'] == peak_hours]['Energy_Production'].sum()

print(f'Optimized Energy Usage during Peak Hours: {optimized_energy_usage}')


```
